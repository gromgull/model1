==========================

------------------------------------

This is a Python implementation of the model 1 translation table estimation 
procedure. Some particulars are described in `m1.py`, the library. `m1demo.py` is a sample application that outputs the translation table. The folder `data` contains 500 parallel sentences from the Canadian Hansards for training (get the rest at <http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/download/hansard/>).
